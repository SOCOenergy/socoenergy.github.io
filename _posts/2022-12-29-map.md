Based in the Cañon City area, our territory runs North to Hartsel, South to Westcliffe, East through Penrose, and West to Gunnison. Anything outside our service area is by appointment only and incurs a $250 day rate travel fee. Travel fees within our territory help us recoup costs for fuel, insurance, maintenance, & tires.</p> <p> <h3>Service Zone 1</h3> </p> <p>There is no travel fee to get a service truck & technician out to your job site if it is within a 10-mile radius of the Cañon City/Florence area.</p> <p> <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="/assets/service_map_1.png"> </p> <p> <h3>Service Zone 2</h3> </p> <p>Beyond 10-miles and up to a 60-mile range is a $60 travel fee.
