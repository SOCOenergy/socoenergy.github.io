description: <p> SOCO Energy corporation is registered with the EPA and adheres to all local, state, and federal regulations to ensure the safe production of quality burner fuel from used oil. Our process is managed to mitigate and minimize the possibility of fire, explosion, or any unplanned release of used oil to air, soil, or surface water which could threaten human health or the environment. We work with a dedicated used oil collection service to ensure that all used oil received by SOCO Energy Corporation is tested prior to pickup for the presence of hazardous materials, like chlorinated halogens. SOCO Energy Corporation has a strict policy for hazardous waste and rejects all used oil found to be above acceptable thresholds across a number of contaminants included in the tests.</p> <p>Every batch of burner fuel produced by SOCO Energy Corporation is guaranteed to be on-specification and fully auditable back to the original oil generator. Additionally, our advanced oil processing techniques ensure that other undesirable contaminants are removed from the burner fuel, like water and other particulates. To learn more about our process or to schedule a site visit you can call or text +1 (877) 333-1776 or email us at <a href="mailto:admin@socoenergy.org">admin@socoenergy.org</a>.
