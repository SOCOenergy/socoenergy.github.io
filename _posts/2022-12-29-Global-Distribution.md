Similarly, potential energy recovery from used oil is limited by market reach. </p> <p>As a used oil marketer, SOCO Energy Corporation works with a global network of energy consumers to ensure that all energy brought online is purchased at a fair market value. No matter where our burner fuel is used, we guarantee fair market value and unlimited demand without the traditional infrastructure barriers to entry.</p> <p>To learn more about our global distribution, email us at <a href="mailto:admin@socoenergy.org">admin@socoenergy.org</a>.
