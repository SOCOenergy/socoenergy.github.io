description: <p> <h2>PRODUCTS</h2> </p> <p><img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="/assets/Couplamatic_Logo.jpg"> </p> <p>We are proud to carry <a href="https://couplamatic.com/">Couplamatic</a> hydraulic hoses and fittings. All Couplamatic fittings are made in the USA. Couplamatic hoses are available in domestic or import for a variety of application-specific designs like extra flexible, abrasion resistant, high-pressure, non-conductive, DOT rated and more.</p> <p>Our service truck is stocked with Couplamatic's 100R16 series hydraulic hose ranging from 1/4" to 1" in diameter. The 100R16 series hydraulic hose features extreme flexibility with a 2" bend radius for the 1/4" diameter hose and a 6" bend radius for the 1" diameter hose. Additional features of the 100R16 series hose include 2-wire braid reinforcement with working pressures ranging from 2,500 PSI for the 1" diameter hose and up to 5,800 PSI for the 1/4" diameter hose. The 100R16 series hose is also features a Mine Safety & Health Administration (MSHA) approved abrasion & flame resistant cover as well as an operating temperature range of -40°F to 212°F.</p> <p>The 100R16 series hose is a great choice for an all around general purpose hydraulic hose for industrial and agricultural applications. Our service truck also carries a selection of Couplamatic fittings for various connection types like NPT or JIC which are available in different configurations like straight angles or 90° elbows. We try to be prepared for any task but if don't have the right part on our truck, we can always get it from our local supplier in a timely manner.</p> <p><img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="/assets/amsoil_logo.jpg"></p> <p>We are also proud to offer the full range of <a href="https://www.amsoil.com/">Amsoil</a> products including engine oil, gear oil, transmission fluid, and hydraulic oil. We offer a standard selection of 6 different oil grades in our Basic and Premium Engine Oil service packages and any of them can be upgraded the equivolent weight Amsoil for both passenger vehicles or heavy equipment, the cost is higher but the benefits may be worth it to you. SOCO Industrial stocks six grades of the <a href="https://amsoilcontent.com/ams/lit/databulletins/g2880.pdf">Amsoil Signature Series 100% synthetic oils</a> and we can get any Amsoil product within three to five business days. Amsoil products are highly engineered oils that provide wear protection, extreme temperature performance, and fuel efficiency that conventional lubricants just can't touch. You may be asking yourself why that is and the answer starts with understanding the two fundamental components in lubricants; base oils and additives. Base oils are categorized into five groups, Group I & Group II are conventional base oils. Groups III, IV, and V are all considered synthetic base oils however, Group III is still made from crude oil where Group IV is a polyalphaolefin and Group V is all other base oils including phosphate ester, silicone, and polyalkylene glycol. Although many lubricants are labeled as "Full Synthetic", it may <a href="https://blog.amsoil.com/100-synthetic-oil-vs-full-synthetic-oil-whats-the-difference/">surprise</a> you to know that a lubricant may be labeled as such provided it uses only Group III, Group IV, or Group V base oils in any combination or ratio. That means a "Full Synthetic" labeled lubricant might be made up of 90% Group III base oil and only 10% Group IV or V base oils. As for "Synthetic Blends", they could contain only 1% synthetic base oil with the other 99% being conventional base oil. When used in with the Amsoil filters, Amsoil Signature Series lubricants deliver up to 25,000 miles or 1-year of engine wear protection under normal service conditions and up to 15,000 miles or 1-year of engine wear protection under severe service. Amsoil Signature Series oils also have 50% more detergents than the Amsoil OE series, the detergents help keep oil passeges clean and battle sludge build up in the engine. Under an <a href="https://www.astm.org/d6891-23.html">ASTM D6891 standard test</a>, Amsoil Signature Series 0W20 oil provided 75% more engine protection against horsepower loss and wear. Some people may claim that Amsoil Signature Series lubricants are over-engineered. Perfect. It's not for everyone. It's for those who want the absolute best engine protection — and it delivers.</p> <p> <h2>SERVICES</h2> </p> <p>SOCO Industrial offers 4 primary mobile services to help keep your equipment running.</p> <p> <h3>1) Hose Crimping Service</h3> <p> <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="/assets/crimping.jpg"></p> <p>Our service truck is equipped to build 2-wire hydraulic hoses ranging from 1/4" up to 1" in diameter.
