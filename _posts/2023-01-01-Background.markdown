description: SOCO Industrial operates with 18 years of hydraulics experience. Starting with the Coors Brewery in 2005 working on high-speed production machines in the aluminum stamping factory that makes the beer can lids in Golden, CO. Followed by 10 years in the railroad industry on Maintenance of Way (MOW) operations. These operations consist of heavy equipment specialized for the railroad. From pulling the spikes, to cutting & lifting the rail, to plugging the spike holes; each piece of equipment was designed for a specific task. SOCO Industrial is a small family owned & operated business serving the southern Colorado region. We decided to start this business because it is what we're good at and we saw a need for it in the area. We honor active duty military and honorably discharged veterans with a discount on our products and services.
