description: SOCO Industrial operates with 18 years of hydraulics experience. Starting with the Coors Brewery in 2005 working on high-speed production machines in the aluminum stamping factory that makes the beer can lids in Golden, CO. These machines stood roughly 15-feet tall and ran at 650 strokes per minute. In total, the one facility would produce more than 4 billion beer can lids annually. The machines were driven by hydrostatic drives for variable speed and up-time was critical in the 24-hour operations of the facility. 

After the Coors Brewery the next 10 years were spent in the railroad industry on Maintenance of Way (MOW) operations. These operations consist of heavy equipment specialized for the railroad. From pulling the spikes, to cutting & lifting the rail, to plugging the spike holes; each piece of equipment was designed for a specific task. The majority of equipment utilizes diesel engines to power air compressors, hydraulic pumps, and sometimes high-voltage generators. With each freight train carrying $1 million dollars of cargo on average, failure was not an option and when a repair was needed it had to be done without causing any delays in train traffic.

SOCO Industrial is a small family owned & operated business serving the southern Colorado region. We decided to start this business because it is what we're good at and we saw a need for it in the area. When the Biden administration started announcing strict mandates on federal contractors during the Covid-19 pandemic it meant some railroad contractors had to decide between keeping their freedom to choose what medical procedures they participate in or keeping their job. In 2021 after being fired from a 10-year career in the railroad industry, we decided to move to the Ca√±on City area where people seemed to be more aligned with our values; freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, & the pursuit of happiness. We honor active duty military and honorably discharged veterans with a discount on our products and services.
